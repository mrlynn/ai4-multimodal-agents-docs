# CLIP vs VLM Architecture Demo

This interactive demonstration illustrates the fundamental differences between **CLIP** (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) and **VLM** (Vision Language Model) architectures for processing multimodal content.

## Key Concepts

### CLIP Architecture
- **Two-tower design**: Separate encoders for text and images
- **Contrastive learning**: Learns to align text and image representations
- **Separate embedding spaces**: Text and visual embeddings exist in distinct spaces
- **Similarity-based retrieval**: Uses cosine similarity to find matching pairs

### VLM Architecture
- **Unified model**: Single backbone processes both modalities
- **Cross-modal attention**: Text and images attend to each other
- **Shared representation**: Both modalities exist in the same embedding space
- **Contextual understanding**: Better suited for reasoning and Q&A tasks

## Interactive Demo

Use the controls below to explore how each architecture processes a multimodal PDF document:

## When to Use Each Architecture

### Use CLIP when you need:
- Fast similarity-based retrieval
- Image-text matching at scale
- Zero-shot classification
- Efficient embedding generation

### Use VLM when you need:
- Complex reasoning over multimodal data
- Question answering with visual context
- Step-by-step explanations
- Grounded understanding of relationships

## Technical Implementation

In the context of our workshop's multimodal PDF agent:

1. **CLIP approach**: Would encode PDF text chunks and images separately, then use vector similarity to retrieve relevant content
2. **VLM approach**: Processes the entire PDF context jointly, enabling the agent to reason about relationships between text and figures

The choice between architectures depends on your specific use case. For our workshop, we leverage embedding models that can handle both approaches, giving you flexibility in implementation.
