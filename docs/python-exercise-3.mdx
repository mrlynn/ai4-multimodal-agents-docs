# Exercise 3: Build AI Agent with Tool Calling

## 🎯 Objective
Create an intelligent agent using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash with function calling capabilities and implement ReAct pattern.

## 📊 Exercise Tasks

### Task 1: Set Up Gemini and Define Function Tools
```python
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
from google.genai.types import FunctionCall

LLM = "gemini-2.0-flash"

# Initialize Gemini client
gemini_client = genai.Client(api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))

# Define function declaration for Gemini
get_information_for_question_answering_declaration = {
    "name": "get_information_for_question_answering",
    "description": "Retrieve information using vector search to answer a user query. Uses VoyageAI embeddings.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "user_query": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Query string to use for vector search",
            }
        },
        "required": ["user_query"],
    },
}

# Create tools configuration
tools = types.Tool(
    function_declarations=[get_information_for_question_answering_declaration]
)
tools_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(tools=[tools], temperature=0.0)

print(f"🤖 Gemini {LLM} configured with function calling!")
```

### Task 2: Implement Core Agent Functions
```python
def select_tool(messages: List) -> FunctionCall | None:
    """Use LLM to decide which tool to call."""
    system_prompt = [(
        "You're an AI assistant. Based on the given information, decide which tool to use. "
        "If the user is asking to explain an image, don't call any tools unless that would help you better explain the image. "
        "Here is the provided information:\n"
    )]
    
    contents = system_prompt + messages
    
    # Generate response using Gemini
    response = gemini_client.models.generate_content(
        model=LLM, contents=contents, config=tools_config
    )
    
    # Extract and return the function call
    if response.candidates and response.candidates[0].content.parts:
        return response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].function_call
    
    return None

def generate_answer(user_query: str, images: List = []) -> str:
    """Execute tools and generate response."""
    # Check if we need to call tools
    tool_call = select_tool([user_query])
    
    if tool_call and tool_call.name == "get_information_for_question_answering":
        print(f"🛠️ Agent calling tool: {tool_call.name}")
        
        # Call the tool with extracted arguments
        tool_images = get_information_for_question_answering(**tool_call.args)
        images.extend(tool_images)
    
    # Prepare system prompt
    system_prompt = (
        "Answer the questions based on the provided context only. "
        "If the context is not sufficient, say I DON'T KNOW. "
        "DO NOT use any other information to answer the question."
    )
    
    # Prepare contents for the LLM
    contents = [system_prompt] + [user_query]
    if images:
        contents.extend([Image.open(image) for image in images])
    
    # Get response from LLM
    response = gemini_client.models.generate_content(
        model=LLM,
        contents=contents,
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(temperature=0.0),
    )
    
    return response.text

def execute_agent(user_query: str, images: List = []) -> None:
    """Execute the agent and display response."""
    print(f"🤖 Processing query: {user_query}")
    response = generate_answer(user_query, images)
    print(f"\n🤖 Agent Response:\n{response}\n")

# Test the agent
print("💬 Testing Agent:")
execute_agent("What is the Pass@1 accuracy of Deepseek R1 on the MATH500 benchmark?")
```

### Task 3: Implement ReAct Pattern
```python
def generate_answer_react(user_query: str, images: List = []) -> str:
    """Implement ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent."""
    print("🧠 Starting ReAct agent processing...")
    
    # Define reasoning prompt
    system_prompt = [(
        "You are an AI assistant with access to VoyageAI embeddings for document search. "
        "Based on the current information, decide if you have enough to answer the user query, "
        "or if you need more information. "
        "If you have enough information, respond with 'ANSWER: <your answer>'. "
        "If you need more information, respond with 'TOOL: <question for the tool>'. "
        f"User query: {user_query}\n"
        "Current information:\n"
    )]
    
    max_iterations = 3
    current_iteration = 0
    current_information = []
    
    # Add user-provided images
    if images:
        current_information.extend([Image.open(img) for img in images])
    
    # Run reasoning → action loop
    while current_iteration < max_iterations:
        current_iteration += 1
        print(f"🔄 ReAct Iteration {current_iteration}:")
        
        # Generate reasoning and decision
        response = gemini_client.models.generate_content(
            model=LLM,
            contents=system_prompt + current_information,
            config=types.GenerateContentConfig(temperature=0.0),
        )
        
        decision = response.text
        print(f"💭 Agent decision: {decision[:100]}...")
        
        # Check for final answer
        if "ANSWER:" in decision:
            final_answer = decision.split("ANSWER:", 1)[1].strip()
            print(f"✅ Final answer reached in {current_iteration} iterations")
            return final_answer
        
        # Check for tool use
        elif "TOOL:" in decision:
            tool_query = decision.split("TOOL:", 1)[1].strip()
            print(f"🛠️ Agent requesting tool with: {tool_query}")
            
            # Call the tool
            tool_call = select_tool([tool_query])
            
            if tool_call and tool_call.name == "get_information_for_question_answering":
                tool_images = get_information_for_question_answering(**tool_call.args)
                
                if tool_images:
                    new_images = [Image.open(img) for img in tool_images]
                    current_information.extend(new_images)
                    print(f"➕ Added {len(new_images)} retrieved images")
                else:
                    current_information.append("No relevant information found.")
    
    return "I couldn't find a definitive answer after exploring the available information."

# Test ReAct agent
print("\n🧠 Testing ReAct Agent:")
execute_react_agent = lambda q: print(f"🤖 ReAct Response:\n{generate_answer_react(q)}\n")
execute_react_agent("What is the Pass@1 accuracy of Deepseek R1 on the MATH500 benchmark?")
```
