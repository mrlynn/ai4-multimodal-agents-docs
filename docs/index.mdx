## 🚀 Workshop Sections

### [🚀 Getting Started](/docs/intro)
Begin your journey with environment setup and n8n basics. Choose between GitHub Codespaces for instant setup or local Docker development.

### [⚙️ Setup & Configuration](/docs/mongodb-atlas-setup)
Configure MongoDB Atlas for vector search and set up Voyage AI for multimodal embeddings. These are the foundational services for your agent.

### [🔧 Building Workflows](/docs/pdf-processing-workflow)
Create powerful automation workflows step by step. Start with PDF processing, implement vector search, and build an AI agent with tool calling.

### [🎯 Advanced Topics](/docs/complete-multimodal-agent)
Take your agent to production with advanced features like memory management, web interfaces, and production-grade vector search.

### [📚 Resources & Support](/docs/local-setup-tips)
Find Docker best practices, troubleshooting guides, and community resources to help you succeed.

## 🎯 What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you'll have created:

- **PDF Ingestion Pipeline**: Automated processing of documents
- **Multimodal Embeddings**: Text and image understanding with Voyage AI
- **Vector Search API**: Fast similarity search with MongoDB Atlas
- **AI Agent**: Intelligent question answering with Gemini 2.0
- **Production Workflows**: Error handling, monitoring, and scaling
