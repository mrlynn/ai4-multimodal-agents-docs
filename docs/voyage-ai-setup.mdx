# üöÄ Voyage AI API Key Setup

## Why You Need a Voyage AI API Key

Voyage AI provides state-of-the-art embedding models that power the multimodal search capabilities in our workshop. Your API key authenticates your requests to Voyage AI's services, allowing you to:
- Generate high-quality multimodal embeddings for text and images
- Access production-ready embedding models optimized for retrieval
- Utilize the official Python client for seamless integration

## Step-by-Step API Key Creation

Follow these steps to create your Voyage AI API key:

### Step 1: Access the Voyage AI Dashboard

Navigate to [https://dashboard.voyageai.com](https://dashboard.voyageai.com) and sign in to your account. If you don't have an account yet, you'll need to create one first.

### Step 4: Configure Your API Key

In the dialog box that appears:
1. **Name your key**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "workshop-multimodal-agent")
2. **Select a project**: Choose the appropriate project or use the default
3. Click **"Create secret key"** to generate your key

### Step 5: Copy and Save Your API Key

Your new API key will be displayed on the screen. This is crucial:

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This is the **only time** you'll be able to see the full API key. Make sure to:
- Click the copy button to copy the key to your clipboard
- Store it securely in your `.env` file
- Never commit API keys to version control

## API Key Permissions

Your Voyage AI key comes with the following permissions:
- ‚úÖ **Read API resources**: Access to retrieve embeddings and model information
- ‚úÖ **Write API resources**: Ability to generate new embeddings
- ‚úÖ **Full access to embedding models**: Including multimodal models

---

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Add to .env File

Create or update your `.env` file with your Voyage AI API key:

```bash
# Voyage AI Configuration
VOYAGE_API_KEY="voy_your_api_key_here"
```

### Verify Your Setup

Test your API key with this Python code:

```python
import voyageai
import os

# Initialize the client with your API key
voyage_client = voyageai.Client(api_key=os.getenv("VOYAGE_API_KEY"))

# Test with a simple embedding
try:
    response = voyage_client.embed(
        texts=["Hello, Voyage AI!"],
        model="voyage-2",
        input_type="document"
    )
    print("‚úÖ API key verified! Ready to generate embeddings.")
    print(f"Embedding dimensions: {len(response.embeddings[0])}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ùå API key verification failed: {e}")
```

## Best Practices for API Key Management

1. **Environment Variables**: Always store your API key in environment variables
2. **Never Share Your Key**: Treat your API key like a password
3. **Use .env Files**: For local development, add `.env` to your `.gitignore`
4. **Rotate Keys Regularly**: For production applications, rotate keys periodically
5. **Monitor Usage**: Check your dashboard regularly for usage and unusual activity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Invalid API Key Error**
- Double-check that you've copied the entire key correctly
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters

**Rate Limiting**
- Free tier accounts may have rate limits
- Check your dashboard for usage limits and upgrade if needed

**Permission Denied**
- Verify your key has access to the models you're trying to use
- Check that the key hasn't been revoked or expired

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
- Check the [Voyage AI Documentation](https://docs.voyageai.com/)
- Review your dashboard for error messages
- Ensure you're using the correct model names
