## 🎯 What We're Building

A production-ready system that:
- **Ingests PDFs** and extracts both text and images
- **Generates multimodal embeddings** using Voyage AI
- **Stores in MongoDB Atlas** with vector search capabilities
- **Provides an AI agent** with tool calling via Gemini 2.0
- **Maintains conversation memory** for context
- **Implements ReAct pattern** for intelligent reasoning

<ExerciseStep stepNumber="1" title="Launch GitHub Codespaces">

**Zero Installation Required!** Everything runs in your browser:

<TerminalCommand 
  command="# Navigate to deployment repository"
  output="Opening: https://github.com/mongodb-developer/multimodal-pdf-agent-n8n"
/>

1. Go to [deployment repository](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/multimodal-pdf-agent-n8n)
2. Click **Code** → **Codespaces** → **Create codespace**  
3. Wait for automatic setup (3-5 minutes first time)
4. All services start automatically

**Requirements:**
- GitHub account (free)
- Web browser
- Internet connection

## 📋 Required for Both Methods

✅ **MongoDB Atlas account** (free tier) - [Sign up](https://www.mongodb.com/try)  
✅ **Google AI Studio API key** for Gemini (optional) - [Get key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)  
✅ **Sample PDFs** for testing  

## 🗺️ Workshop Journey

1. **Environment Setup** → Get all tools configured
2. **PDF Processing** → Build ingestion workflow
3. **Vector Search** → Implement similarity search
4. **AI Agent** → Create intelligent assistant
5. **Memory & Context** → Add conversation history
6. **ReAct Pattern** → Implement reasoning loops
7. **Production Deploy** → Scale your solution

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Multimodal Embeddings
Voyage AI's `voyage-multimodal-3` model processes both text and images into a unified vector space, enabling semantic search across different content types.

### Vector Search
MongoDB Atlas Vector Search provides efficient similarity search at scale, perfect for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) applications.

### Visual Workflows
n8n's node-based interface makes complex integrations intuitive, with built-in error handling and monitoring.

### Agent Patterns
We'll implement industry-standard patterns like tool calling and ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) for intelligent agent behavior.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

1. **Design and build** visual AI workflows in n8n
2. **Process multimodal content** from PDFs
3. **Implement vector search** with MongoDB Atlas
4. **Create AI agents** with tool calling capabilities
5. **Add memory** to maintain context
6. **Deploy to production** with confidence
