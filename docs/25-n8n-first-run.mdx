# ðŸš€ n8n First Run Experience

Let's walk through what happens when you first access n8n in our Docker environment.

## Starting n8n with Docker

With our Docker setup, n8n is already running! Check the status:

```bash
# Check if n8n is running
docker-compose ps

# You should see:
NAME           IMAGE              STATUS       PORTS
n8n-workshop   n8nio/n8n:latest   Up X mins    0.0.0.0:5678->5678/tcp
```

If n8n isn't running:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Wait 10-15 seconds for services to initialize
# Then check logs
docker-compose logs n8n
```

2. You should see output with your test data

## Pro Tips from the Field

### ðŸ’¡ Installation Tips

Based on real experience:

1. **Always use Node 22** - v24 doesn't work
2. **Use npm, not Homebrew** for n8n install
3. **Activate free license immediately** for better features
4. **Start simple** - test basic nodes first

### ðŸŽ¯ Workflow Development Tips

1. **Name your workflows** clearly
2. **Use folders** to organize (with free license)
3. **Test incrementally** - node by node
4. **Save often** - use Ctrl/Cmd+S

### ðŸ”§ Useful Settings

Enable these for better experience:

1. **Settings** â†’ **Workflow Defaults**
    - Save execution progress: ON
    - Save manual executions: ON
2. **Settings** â†’ **Personal**
    - Execution timeout: 5 minutes (for our workshop)

## Common First-Time Issues

### "Site can't be reached"

- Make sure n8n is running in terminal
- Check [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678/) (not https)
- Verify no firewall blocking

### "Invalid Node Version"

```bash
# Quick fix:
nvm use 22
n8n
```

### "License Key Not Working"

- Click the link in email (don't copy/paste)
- Check spam folder
- Request new key if needed

## Next Steps
