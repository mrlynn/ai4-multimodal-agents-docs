  notes={[
    "This is often where attendees encounter their first issues",
    "Common problems: Docker not running, ports in use, browser cache",
    "Have attendees confirm they can access n8n before proceeding",
    "License activation email sometimes goes to spam folder"

  tips={[
    "Share your own n8n screen to show what success looks like",

<WorkshopExercise 
  title="Launch and Configure n8n"

<ExerciseStep stepNumber="1" title="Verify n8n Service">

With our Docker setup, n8n should already be running! Let's verify:

<TerminalCommand 
  command="docker-compose ps"
  output={`NAME           IMAGE              STATUS       PORTS
n8n-workshop   n8nio/n8n:latest   Up 2 mins    0.0.0.0:5678->5678/tcp
mongodb        mongo:7.0          Up 2 mins    0.0.0.0:27017->27017/tcp`}
/>

If n8n isn't running, start the services:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="Start All Services">
{`# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Wait 10-15 seconds for services to initialize
# Then check logs
docker-compose logs n8n`}
</CodeBlock>

<ServiceTester 
  serviceName="n8n" 
  testUrl="http://localhost:5678"
  testData={{}}
/>

</ExerciseStep>

<ExerciseStep stepNumber="2" title="Complete Initial Setup Wizard">

Navigate to `http://localhost:5678` in your browser:

**Account Creation:**
- Enter your email address
- Create a secure password  
- You're automatically on the Community Edition (perfect for learning!)

## Understanding the n8n Interface

### Main Navigation

<Screenshot src="/img/n8n-1.png" alt="n8n Overview Dashboard" />

### Workflow Canvas

When you create a new workflow:

1. **Canvas**: Main work area
2. **Node Panel**: Click + to add nodes
3. **Node Search**: Type to find nodes
4. **Execution Panel**: See run results

<Screenshot src="/img/n8n-2.png" alt="n8n Overview Dashboard" />

## Your First Test

Let's verify everything works:

### 1. Create Test Workflow

1. Click **Workflows** â†’ **New**
2. You'll see a blank canvas with "Start" node

### 2. Add a Simple Node

1. Click the **+** button next to the trigger node
2. In the search field at the top, type "Set"
3. Look for **"Edit Fields (Set)"** option (has a pencil icon)
4. Click on it to add the node
5. The node will be automatically connected to your trigger
6. Configure the Set node:
   - Click on the Set node to open its settings
   - You'll see fields to add data
   - Add a field with:
     - Name: `test`
     - Value: `Hello n8n!`
   - Add another field:
     - Name: `timestamp`
     - Value: `{{ new Date().toISOString() }}`
    

### 3. Execute

1. Click **Execute Workflow**
2. You should see output with your test data

## Pro Tips from the Field

### ðŸ’¡ Installation Tips

Based on real experience:

1. **Always use Node 22** - v24 doesn't work
2. **Use npm, not Homebrew** for n8n install
3. **Activate free license immediately** for better features
4. **Start simple** - test basic nodes first

### ðŸŽ¯ Workflow Development Tips

1. **Name your workflows** clearly
2. **Use folders** to organize (with free license)
3. **Test incrementally** - node by node
4. **Save often** - use Ctrl/Cmd+S

### ðŸ”§ Useful Settings

Enable these for better experience:

1. **Settings** â†’ **Workflow Defaults**
    - Save execution progress: ON
    - Save manual executions: ON
2. **Settings** â†’ **Personal**
    - Execution timeout: 5 minutes (for our workshop)

## Common First-Time Issues

### "Site can't be reached"

- Make sure n8n is running in terminal
- Check [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678/) (not https)
- Verify no firewall blocking

### "Invalid Node Version"

```bash
# Quick fix:
nvm use 22
n8n
```

### "License Key Not Working"

- Click the link in email (don't copy/paste)
- Check spam folder
- Request new key if needed

## Next Steps

Now that n8n is running:

âœ… n8n installed and running  
âœ… Account created  
âœ… Free license activated  
âœ… Interface explored  
âœ… First test workflow created
