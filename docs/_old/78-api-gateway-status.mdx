# 🌐 Workshop API Gateway Status

Monitor the health and availability of workshop services in real-time.

<LiveStatusBadge showDetails={true} />

## 🎯 What You're Seeing

The Workshop API Gateway provides essential services for the workshop:

### Core Services
- **🔗 Embedding Service**: Generates vector embeddings using Voyage AI
- **🤖 AI Generation**: Provides access to Google Gemini for AI responses
- **🛡️ Rate Limiting**: Ensures fair usage across all workshop participants
- **🌐 CORS Support**: Enables browser-based requests from the documentation

### Service Status Indicators
- **🟢 Available**: Service is fully operational
- **🔴 Unavailable**: Service is down or not configured
- **🟡 Partial**: Core functionality works but some features may be limited

## 📊 Understanding the Health Data

When you expand the status details, you'll see:

### Version Information
- Current API version
- Last deployment information
- Feature flags and capabilities

### Service Availability
Each service shows its current status:
```json
{
  "embedding": {
    "available": true,
    "endpoint": "/api/embed", 
    "provider": "Voyage AI"
  },
  "ai_generation": {
    "available": false,
    "endpoint": "/api/gemini",
    "provider": "Google Gemini"
  }
}
```

### Uptime Metrics
- **Uptime**: How long the service has been running
- **Response Time**: Current API response latency
- **System Load**: Overall system health

## 🚨 Common Status Scenarios

### All Services Online ✅
```
✅ Workshop API Gateway: Online
  Services:
  🟢 embedding: Available (Voyage AI)
  🟢 ai generation: Available (Google Gemini)
  Uptime: 123 minutes
  Version: 1.1.0
```
**Meaning**: Everything is working perfectly!

### Partial Services Available 🟡
```
🟡 Workshop API Gateway: Partial
  Services:
  🟢 embedding: Available (Voyage AI)
  🔴 ai generation: Unavailable (Google Gemini)
  Uptime: 45 minutes
  Version: 1.1.0
```
**Meaning**: Embedding generation works, but AI responses may not. You can still complete most workshop exercises.

### Gateway Offline ❌
```
❌ Workshop API Gateway: Error
  Error: Request timeout
```
**Meaning**: The workshop services are temporarily unavailable. Try refreshing or wait a few minutes.

## 🔧 Using Status Information

### For Workshop Participants
- **Green status**: Proceed with all exercises
- **Yellow status**: Focus on embedding-related exercises first
- **Red status**: Wait for services to recover or use mock workflows

### For Instructors
- **Monitor the dashboard** before starting exercises
- **Have backup plans** when services show partial status
- **Use the detailed information** to guide troubleshooting

## 🔄 Automatic Monitoring

The status badge automatically:
- **Refreshes every 30 seconds** to show current status
- **Shows real-time service availability** for each component
- **Provides detailed error messages** when services are down
- **Tracks uptime and performance metrics** for monitoring

## 💡 Tips for Best Experience

1. **Check status before starting** each workshop section
2. **Refresh manually** if you suspect stale data (🔄 button)
3. **Expand details** to see which specific services are affected
4. **Use alternative workflows** when services are partially available

## 🛠️ API Gateway Architecture

The workshop gateway provides:

### Security Layer
- API key management (no keys needed for participants)
- Rate limiting (fair usage across all participants)
- Request validation and sanitization

### Service Orchestration
- Routes requests to appropriate AI providers
- Handles authentication with external services
- Provides unified response format

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Tracks usage patterns and performance
- Provides health checks and status reporting
- Logs errors for troubleshooting

### Cost Management
- Manages API costs across all workshop participants
- Provides usage analytics for optimization
- Implements quotas and fair usage policies

## 📈 Performance Metrics

The gateway tracks:
- **Request volume**: Number of API calls per minute
- **Response times**: Average latency for each service
- **Error rates**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Service uptime**: Availability over time

This data helps ensure a smooth workshop experience for everyone! 🎉

## 🚀 Next Steps

With the API Gateway monitoring in place:
1. **Verify all services are online** before starting exercises
2. **Monitor status during workshop** to catch issues early
3. **Use the troubleshooting guides** when problems arise
4. **Focus on available services** when others are down

The real-time status monitoring ensures you always know the health of your workshop environment! 📊✨
