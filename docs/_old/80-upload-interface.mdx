# üåê Web Upload Interface

A complete web interface for uploading PDFs and chatting with your multimodal agent.

## Accessing the Interface

### Option 1: Via Docusaurus (Recommended)

The upload interface is available at:
```
http://localhost:3000/upload-interface.html
```

### Option 2: Direct File Access

Open the file directly in your browser:
```
/workspaces/multimodal-pdf-agent-n8n-docs/static/upload-interface.html
```
(Note: The upload interface is in the documentation repository)

## Features

### üì§ PDF Upload
- **Drag & Drop** support
- **Click to browse** file selection
- **Automatic validation** (PDF files only)
- **Progress feedback** during processing

### üí¨ Chat Interface
- **Real-time Q&A** about uploaded PDFs
- **Conversation history** display
- **Loading indicators** for responses
- **Error handling** with clear messages

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Import the Workflow

First, import the real multimodal agent workflow:
```
/workspaces/multimodal-pdf-agent-n8n/init/workflows/06-real-voyage-multimodal.json
```

### 2. Configure Webhook URLs

The interface expects these webhook endpoints:
- **Upload**: `http://localhost:5678/webhook/pdf-upload`
- **Chat**: `http://localhost:5678/webhook/ask`

### 3. Start the Workflow

1. Open the imported workflow in n8n
2. Click **"Active"** toggle to enable
3. The webhooks are now ready to receive requests

## Using the Interface

### Step 1: Upload a PDF

1. **Drag a PDF** onto the upload area, or
2. **Click "Choose PDF File"** to browse
3. Wait for "Successfully processed" message
4. The chat interface will appear automatically

### Step 2: Ask Questions

1. Type your question in the input field
2. Press **Enter** or click **Ask**
3. Watch the AI analyze your PDF and respond
4. Continue the conversation with follow-up questions

## Example Questions

Try these types of questions:
- "What is the main topic of this document?"
- "Summarize the key findings"
- "What does it say about [specific topic]?"
- "List the main recommendations"

## Customization

### Modify the Interface

Edit `/static/upload-interface.html` (in the docs repository) to:
- Change colors and styling
- Add additional features
- Modify the layout

### Update Webhook URLs

If using different ports or paths:
```javascript
const UPLOAD_URL = 'http://localhost:5678/webhook/pdf-upload';
const ASK_URL = 'http://localhost:5678/webhook/ask';
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" Error
- Ensure n8n workflow is active
- Check webhook URLs match your setup
- Verify MongoDB is running

### "No file uploaded" Error
- Ensure file is a valid PDF
- Check file size (keep under 10MB for testing)
- Verify binary data handling in webhook

### Chat Not Appearing
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure PDF was processed successfully
- Verify MongoDB stored the document

## Production Deployment

For production use:
1. Update URLs to use HTTPS
2. Add authentication/security
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Add file size restrictions
5. Enable CORS properly

Your complete multimodal PDF agent is now accessible via a user-friendly web interface!
