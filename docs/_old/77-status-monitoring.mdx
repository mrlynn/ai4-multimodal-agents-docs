# 📊 Workshop Status Monitoring

The LiveStatusBadge component helps you monitor the health of your workshop environment in real-time.

## 🎯 What It Monitors

The status badge checks three key systems:

### 1. Workshop API Gateway ✅
- **What**: The embedding and proxy services
- **Endpoint**: `https://workshop-embedding-api.vercel.app/api/health`
- **Purpose**: Ensures you can generate embeddings and access AI services
- **Always Available**: This is maintained by the workshop organizers

### 2. n8n Workflow Engine 🔧
- **What**: Your local n8n instance running in Codespace
- **Endpoint**: `https://your-codespace-5678.app.github.dev/healthz`
- **Purpose**: Verifies your workflow automation engine is running
- **Configurable**: You need to set this up based on your Codespace

### 3. MongoDB Atlas 🗄️
- **What**: Your vector database connection
- **How it works**: 
  - If you provide a connection string → Tests your specific Atlas cluster
  - If no connection string → Shows generic MongoDB service status
- **Purpose**: Ensures your database is accessible for storing embeddings

## 🔧 Configuration

### Simple Setup (Recommended)
1. Click the ⚙️ gear icon on any status badge
2. **n8n URL**: Auto-detected for Codespaces or enter manually
3. **MongoDB Connection String**: Optional - paste your Atlas connection string
4. Click "Save Configuration"

### What Each Field Does

#### n8n Workflow Engine URL
```
https://your-codespace-5678.app.github.dev/healthz
```
- **Purpose**: Check if your n8n instance is running
- **Auto-detection**: Works automatically in GitHub Codespaces
- **Manual setup**: Find your Codespace port 5678 URL and add `/healthz`

#### MongoDB Atlas Connection String (Optional)
```
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
```
- **Purpose**: Test your specific MongoDB Atlas connection
- **Security**: Stored locally in your browser, never sent to servers
- **Optional**: Leave empty for generic MongoDB service checks

## 🚨 Understanding Status Indicators

### System Status Colors
- 🟢 **Green (Online)**: System is healthy and responsive
- 🔴 **Red (Error)**: System is unreachable or returning errors  
- 🟡 **Yellow (Timeout)**: System is slow or partially responsive
- ⚪ **Gray (Loading)**: Currently checking system status

### Common Scenarios

#### All Green ✅
```
✅ Workshop API Gateway: Online
✅ n8n Workflow Engine: Online  
✅ MongoDB Atlas: Online (your Atlas instance)
```
**Meaning**: Everything is working perfectly! Ready for all workshop exercises.

#### n8n Issues ⚠️
```
✅ Workshop API Gateway: Online
❌ n8n Workflow Engine: Service not running locally
✅ MongoDB Atlas: Online
```
**Solution**: 
1. Check if your Codespace is running
2. Verify n8n is started (`npm run dev`)
3. Update the n8n URL in configuration

#### MongoDB Issues ⚠️  
```
✅ Workshop API Gateway: Online
✅ n8n Workflow Engine: Online
❌ MongoDB Atlas: Connection failed
```
**Solution**:
1. Verify your MongoDB Atlas connection string
2. Check Atlas cluster is running
3. Ensure network access is configured
4. Test with workshop exercises that use generic MongoDB checks

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Configuration Not Saving
- **Issue**: Settings reset after page refresh
- **Solution**: Check browser localStorage permissions
- **Workaround**: Re-enter settings each session

### Auto-Detection Not Working
- **Issue**: n8n URL not detected automatically
- **Solution**: Manually enter your Codespace port 5678 URL
- **Format**: `https://[codespace-name]-5678.app.github.dev/healthz`

### MongoDB Connection Errors
- **Issue**: "Connection failed" even with correct string
- **Solution**: 
  1. Remove the connection string to use generic checks
  2. Verify the string includes credentials and database name
  3. Check Atlas network access settings

### False Positives/Negatives
- **Issue**: Status shows error but service works fine
- **Solution**: Network issues or CORS restrictions
- **Workaround**: Click refresh (🔄) to retry the check

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Workshop Participants
1. **Check status before starting exercises**
2. **Configure your specific MongoDB connection** for accurate monitoring
3. **Use the refresh button** if you see stale status
4. **Keep the badge expanded** during exercises to monitor issues

### For Instructors
1. **Monitor the dashboard view** to see participant system health
2. **Have backup plans** for when services are down
3. **Show participants how to configure** their status monitoring
4. **Use status colors** to quickly identify who needs help

## 🎯 Privacy & Security

### Data Handling
- **Connection strings**: Stored only in your browser's localStorage
- **Health checks**: Only test connectivity, no data transmission
- **Privacy**: No personal data sent to workshop servers

### Security Notes
- Connection strings are masked in the UI (password field)
- Data never leaves your browser except for health check requests
- MongoDB connections are tested via workshop proxy for security

## 📚 Integration with Workshop Content  

The status badge appears throughout the documentation to help you:
- **Verify prerequisites** before starting sections
- **Debug issues** when exercises don't work
- **Monitor system health** during complex workflows
- **Ensure readiness** for production deployment

Look for the status badge on key pages like:
- MongoDB Atlas setup
- n8n configuration
- Workflow testing
- Production deployment

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Endpoints
You can modify the component to check additional services by editing the configuration or extending the systems array.

### API Integration
The status checks use standard HTTP health check patterns:
- `GET /healthz` for service health
- `POST /api/check-db` for database connectivity
- Standard HTTP status codes for responses

### Monitoring Dashboard
For instructors, the expanded view provides a real-time dashboard of all workshop systems, perfect for monitoring during live sessions.

The status monitoring system ensures everyone has a smooth workshop experience by providing immediate feedback on system health! 🎉
